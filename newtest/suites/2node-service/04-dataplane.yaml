  Dataplane connectivity tests for service types provisioned by the topology.
  Tests EVPN L2 cross-switch forwarding (VXLAN VNI 10300) and IRB gateway
  reachability (SVI 10.100.1.1/24 on VLAN 100).
topology: 2node-service
requires: [provision]
after: [verify-health]

steps:
  # =========================================================================
  # Test 1: EVPN L2 cross-switch (host3 ↔ host6, VLAN 300, VNI 10300)
  # =========================================================================

  # host3 (switch1:Ethernet3) and host6 (switch2:Ethernet3) are in VLAN 300
  # with untagged membership. EVPN L2 overlay (VNI 10300) extends L2 domain
  # across switches via VXLAN.

  # =========================================================================
  # Test 2: IRB gateway reachability (host1 → SVI on switch1)
  # =========================================================================

  # host1 (switch1:Ethernet1) is in VLAN 100 with tagged membership (IRB
  # service type). Host needs a VLAN sub-interface to send tagged frames.
  # SVI is 10.100.1.1/24.
  #
  # newtlab auto-derives a host IP onto eth0 from the switch-side topology IP.
  # Since the switch port is a tagged VLAN member, untagged eth0 traffic won't
  # reach the SVI. Flush eth0 addresses and use eth0.100 instead.
