  Dataplane connectivity tests for service types provisioned by the topology.
  Tests EVPN L2 cross-switch forwarding (VXLAN VNI 10300), EVPN IRB inter-subnet
  routing (VLAN 400 ↔ VLAN 401 via Vrf_irb, L3VNI 50400), and local IRB gateway
  reachability (SVI 10.100.1.1/24 on VLAN 100).
topology: 2node-service
requires: [provision]
after: [verify-health]

steps:
  # =========================================================================
  # Test 1: EVPN L2 cross-switch (host3 ↔ host6, VLAN 300, VNI 10300)
  # =========================================================================

  # host3 (switch1:Ethernet3) and host6 (switch2:Ethernet3) are in VLAN 300
  # with untagged membership. EVPN L2 overlay (VNI 10300) extends L2 domain
  # across switches via VXLAN.

  # =========================================================================
  # Test 2: EVPN IRB inter-subnet routing (host7 ↔ host8, Vrf_irb)
  # =========================================================================

  # host7 (switch1:Ethernet4) is in VLAN 400 (10.1.40.0/24, VNI 10400).
  # host8 (switch2:Ethernet4) is in VLAN 401 (10.1.41.0/24, VNI 10401).
  # Both VLANs are bound to Vrf_irb via the irb-vrf IPVPN (L3VNI 50400).
  # Each switch has an anycast SVI for its local VLAN only.
  #
  # Inter-subnet traffic (10.1.40.x ↔ 10.1.41.x) MUST be routed through
  # the IRB gateway — it cannot take the L2 bridged path because the hosts
  # are in different VLANs/subnets. This exercises the full EVPN IRB L3
  # routing path: host → local SVI → Vrf_irb → VXLAN L3VNI → remote SVI → host.

  # =========================================================================

  # service type). Host needs a VLAN sub-interface to send tagged frames.
  # SVI is 10.100.1.1/24.
  #
  # newtlab auto-derives a host IP onto eth0 from the switch-side topology IP.
  # Since the switch port is a tagged VLAN member, untagged eth0 traffic won't
  # reach the SVI. Flush eth0 addresses and use eth0.100 instead.
